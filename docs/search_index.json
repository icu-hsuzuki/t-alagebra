The style is a bit different from this HTML version MEMO April 4, 1995. This is a lecture note based on a series of lectures by Paul Terwilliger in 1993. The original is a manuscript written by Paul Terwilliger. This note was rewritten by Hirosh Suzuki when he studied the lecture note during the following period. January 13, 1995 – March 4, 1995. He had a chance to meet the author for a week after reading through the lecture note. The author clarified almost everything he asked about. So even in the part where he put “?”, there seems to be no mathematical gap. But sometimes, it requires lengthy calculations. In the last part, each result has two numbers because the original lecture note has duplications. He supposes that this lecture note is already two years old, so some parts are improved essentially.
