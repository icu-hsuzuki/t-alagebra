A graph (undirected, without loops or multiple edges) is a pair $\Gamma = (X, E)$, where 
\begin{align}
X &= \textrm{finite set (of vertices)}\\
E & = \textrm{set of (distinct) 2-element subsets of }X \textrm{ (= edges of ) }\Gamma.
\end{align}
vertices $x$ and $y\in X$ are adjacent if and only if $xy\in E$.
