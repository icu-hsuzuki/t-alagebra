| (S) $\Rightarrow$ (C)
Fix $i$ and pick $a, b\in E_i^*TE_i^*$. 

Since $a$, $b$ and $ab$ are symmetric, 
$$ab = (ab)^\top = b^\top a^\top = ba.$$
Hence $E_i^*TE_i^*$ is commutative. 

| (G) $\Rightarrow$ (S)
Fix $i$ and pick $a \in E_i^*TE_i^*$. Pick vertices $y, z\in X$. 

We want to show that 
$$a_{yz} = a_{zy}.$$
We may assume that 
$$\partial(x, y) = \partial(x,z) = i,$$
othewise 
$$a_{yz} = a_{zy} = 0.$$
By our assumption, there exists $g\in G$ such that
$$g(y) = z, \quad g(z) = y, \quad g(x) = x.$$
Let $\hat{g}$ denote the permutation matrix representing $g$, i.e., 
$$\hat{g}\hat{y} =\widehat{g(y)} \quad \text{for all }\ y\in X, \quad \hat{y} = \begin{pmatrix}0\\\vdots \\ 1 \\\vdots \\0\end{pmatrix}\begin{matrix} \\ \\ \leftarrow y \\ \\ \text{ } \end{matrix}.$$
If $g\in \mathrm{Aut}(\Gamma)$, then
$$\hat{g}A = A\hat{g} \quad \text{Exercise}.$$
Also we have 
$$\hat{g}E_j^* = E^*_j\hat{g} \quad (0\leq j\leq D),$$
since 
$$\partial(x,y) = \partial(g(x), g(y)) = \partial(x, g(y)).$$
Hence $\hat{g}$ commutes with each element of $T$. We have
\begin{align}
a_{yz} & = (\hat{g}^{-1}a\hat{g})_{yz}, \quad (\hat{g})_{yz} = \begin{cases} 1 & g(z) = y\\ 0 & \text{else.}\end{cases}\\
& = \sum_{y', z'}(\hat{g}^{-1})_{yy'}a_{y'z'}\hat{g}_{z'z}\\
& \quad (\text{zero except for $g^{-1}(y') = y, \; g(z) = z'$}.)\\
& = a_{g(y)g(z)}\\
& a_{zy}.
\end{align}
This proves Theorem  \@ref(thm:thin-condition).

**Open Problem:**
Find all the graphs that satisfy the condition (G) for every vertex $x$.

$H(N, 2)$ is one example, because
$$\mathrm{Aut}\Gamma_{1\cdots 1} \simeq S_\Omega, \quad x = (1\cdots 1), \Gamma_i(x)
 = \{\hat{S} \mid |S| = i\}.$$

Property (G) is clearly related to the distance-transitive property.

:::{.definition}
Let $\Gamma = (X, E)$ be any graph. $\Gamma$ with $G\subseteq \mathrm{Aut}(\Gamma)$ is said to be distance-transitive \index{distance-transitive} (or two-point homogeneous), whenever 
$$\text{for all } x, x', y, y'\in X \; \text{ with } \partial(x,y) = \partial(x',y'),$$ 
there exists $g\in G$ such that
$$g(x) = y,\quad g(x') = y'.$$
(This means $G$ is as close to being doubly transitive as possible.)
